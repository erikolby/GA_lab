# Wiki for lab assignment in the course Genome Analysis (1MB462)
This repository holds the planning and the code for the lab assignment in the course Genome Analysis. 
## Project plan 
### Overview of the project  
Should include: 
* Goals  
* Type of sample  
* Type of data 
*	Conclusions of the study

This project will reproduce the study described in the article *“The draft genome of tropical fruit durian Durio zibethinus”* made by Teh *et al.* 2017.
The goal in this study was to aquire more genetic knowledge about the famous durian fruit. The understanding of the underlying genomics and transcriptomics of the fruit is of great importance due to the major economical role it plays in China and parts of Southeast Asia. The results from this study is of value when trying to understand the function and the agronomy of this fruit.

In the context of this project, the goal is to get biologically interpretable results that hopefully is similiair to the results that Teh *et al.* got.  

The type of data 
### Which analyses / softwares
•	Most relevant analyses

### Time frame 
## DNA assembly 
# Canu - 17 hours - 4 cores.
The program Canu will be used on the trimmed PacBio reads for the DNA assembly. This will take long time and meanwhile this is done, the RNA assembly can be started as well. 
# Pilon - 30 min - 2 cores. 

## RNA assembly 
# T
Should include: 
Attention to checkpoints 
Plan for long running times 

### Data management plan
My plan is to keep the source-files of the data in a compressed format and with their original name in a folder data/raw_data. the trimmed data will also be in their original form in data/trimmed_data. There will be references to these datafiles with other names in the analysis subfolders. All of the analysis-folders will be namned beginning with a number depending on when they are done so that the structure will be easy to follow. The code will be kept in a separate folder as well.
